   "World’s largest X-ray laser generates first light",
   "Based in Germany, the European XFEL is a 3.4km long facility, most of which is located in underground tunnels. Once operational, it will be the largest and most powerful of the five X-ray lasers worldwide, with the ability to generate the short pulses of hard X-ray light. The X-ray light has a wavelength of 0.8nm – about 500 times shorter than that of visible light. At first lasing, the laser had a repetition rate of one pulse per second, which will later increase to 27 000 per second.",

   "Starcraft If i buy Only wings of liberty will i have Ranked mode and unranked?",
   "wings of liberty, heart of the swarm and legacy of the void all have separate ladder systems. Yes you can play ranked/unranked on the wol ladder, but you won't have access to the stuff added to multiplayer in hots/lotv and you can't play against people playing those ladders. You can also just buy lotv and play the lotv multiplayer which is the most up to date and has the largest player base",
